## Benchmarking the parsing of complete PDB database with the atom count

For evaluating the performance and speed of our MAT parser we have used the whole PDB  (https://www.rcsb.org/) database. These files were downlaoded on Nov 21, 2018. A total number of 145787 files were parsed and tested.

## Comparison among programs
For comparison, we have taken following tools and programs:
* BioJulia https://biojulia.net/
* BioPerl https://bioperl.org/
* BioPython https://biopython.org
* ESBTL (Easy Structural Biology Template Library) http://esbtl.sourceforge.net
* hpdb http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB
* MAT (Macromolecular Analysis Toolkit) http://mat.iitr.ac.in 
* Pymol https://pymol.org
* Victor C++ http://protein.bio.unipd.it/victor/index.php/Main_Page
